# KD-Tree Retrieval Augmented Generation

Code example that uses llama.cpp to generate embeddings from a .txt file and uses the Eigen library to handle and manipulate the embedding vectors.

This assumes:

* You have already built llama.cpp and have a model (ggml or gguf format).
* You have installed Eigen.
* You are using a recent version of llama.cpp and a model withembedding support (GGUF compatible).

## Llama.cpp install
